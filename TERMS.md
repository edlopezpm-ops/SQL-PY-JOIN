# Use and service boundaries — SQL-PY-JOIN

Reviewed 2026-11-01.

## What is provided

Use disposable databases only. Explicit commit mode deletes and reloads the join-reference table. Transaction rollback is not a general sandbox, and a printed SQL error may not produce a failing client exit code. The proposed future SaaS is not a delivered service.

There is no service subscription, availability commitment or support SLA created by
reading or running this repository. A separate written agreement is needed for any
professional delivery or hosted service. Review the actual deployment before relying
on it; source visibility is not evidence of a production service or compliance certification.

## License and ownership take precedence

No root project license has been selected. Neither the learning goal nor public hosting grants a general license to redistribute the SQL script or other project material.

These notes describe operating boundaries, not a click-through agreement or a new
software license. Existing license grants and applicable rights take precedence over
these notes. Third-party code, runtimes, marks and personal material retain their own
rights and notices. AEKR provenance identifies an engineering workflow, not third-party
sponsorship or an engineering/security certification.

## Use with appropriate authority

Use systems and data you are authorized to access. Keep confidential or personal
material out of public issues and commits. Before adapting an example to a real system,
review inputs, effects, recovery and applicable provider terms. No paid model API,
credential, data transfer or production change is authorized by these notes.

Follow the [privacy notice](PRIVACY.md), [licensing inventory](docs/licensing.md) and
[security reporting guidance](SECURITY.md). Questions and requests for a separate
permission or service agreement go to [aekr@aekr.io](mailto:aekr@aekr.io).
Changes to these notes do not retroactively withdraw existing license permissions or
authorize a new use of previously collected information.
