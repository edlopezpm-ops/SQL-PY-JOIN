# Use and service boundaries — SQL-PY-JOIN

Reviewed 2026-11-12.

<!-- (kommiBo) Explicit reference to the separately scoped AEKR website terms. -->
## Relationship to the AEKR website terms

The [AEKR website Terms of Service](https://aekr.io/terms), version **20261025**
reviewed on 2026-11-12, describe use of the AEKR website and its available functions.
Their separate-service, explicit-choice and material-rights boundaries inform these
repository notes. They do not replace this repository's license, its project-specific
use limits or a separately agreed service contract.

Reading, cloning or linking this repository does not record acceptance of the website
terms. Website contact or research forms have their own actual acknowledgment process;
this Markdown file implements none. The website's [Privacy](https://aekr.io/privacy)
and [Cookies](https://aekr.io/cookies) notices describe that website's processing, while
the [repository privacy notice](PRIVACY.md) describes this project's scope. Linking
those notices adds no analytics, data collection, consent record or cross-product
identity link to this repository.

The linked site can change independently. The version above records the reference
reviewed for this update, not automatic acceptance of later versions or a retroactive
change to existing permissions. Questions about the applicable surface or version go
to [aekr@aekr.io](mailto:aekr@aekr.io).

## What is provided

Use disposable databases only. Explicit commit mode deletes and reloads the join-reference table. Transaction rollback is not a general sandbox, and a printed SQL error may not produce a failing client exit code. The proposed future SaaS is not a delivered service.

There is no service subscription, availability commitment or support SLA created by
reading or running this repository. A separate written agreement is needed for any
professional delivery or hosted service. Review the actual deployment before relying
on it; source visibility is not evidence of a production service or compliance certification.

<!-- (kommiBo) User responsibility, outcome limits and non-waivable rights. -->
## Your responsibility to understand and validate use

Before running or adapting the project, read its purpose, requirements, instructions and
documented limitations. You are responsible for assessing whether you have the technical
knowledge, authorized systems and data, and suitable environment to use it safely. If you
do not understand an instruction or possible effect, pause and seek clarification or
competent assistance before proceeding. AEKR branding is not a substitute for that review.

You control your environment, configuration, inputs, modifications and decisions to deploy
or rely on outputs. Validate results for your intended use and take appropriate precautions,
including isolation and recovery arrangements where effects could matter.

For this SQL exercise, use an authorized disposable database, keep recoverable backups where appropriate, and inspect the target and transaction mode before execution. You are responsible for any decision to enable commit mode or adapt the script to a persistent database.

## No guaranteed outcome or individual suitability

AEKR does not guarantee that this project will meet your personal or business goals, run
successfully in every environment, or produce a particular result. Difficulty installing,
running or understanding it does not by itself create a promise of successful results,
individual training or custom support. Any applicable license, written agreement and
mandatory legal obligations continue to govern.

## Responsibility for misuse and limits on exclusions

To the extent permitted by applicable law, AEKR is not responsible for loss or damage
caused by your misuse, unauthorized use, modifications, disregard of documented requirements
or warnings, or reliance on outputs without appropriate validation. An unsuccessful attempt,
unexpected result or misunderstanding does not by itself establish that AEKR promised a
successful outcome or accepted responsibility for your independent decisions.

Nothing in these notes excludes or limits rights that cannot lawfully be waived, liability
that cannot lawfully be excluded or limited, or obligations under an applicable license or
separate written agreement. These notes do not excuse AEKR from its own mandatory duties
or establish that every failure is the user's fault. They provide no new license grant and
do not change the existing project's permissions or copyright ownership.

## License and ownership take precedence

No root project license has been selected. Neither the learning goal nor public hosting grants a general license to redistribute the SQL script or other project material.

These notes describe operating boundaries, not a click-through agreement or a new
software license. Existing license grants and applicable rights take precedence over
these notes. Third-party code, runtimes, marks and personal material retain their own
rights and notices. AEKR provenance identifies an engineering workflow, not third-party
sponsorship or an engineering/security certification.

## Use with appropriate authority

Use systems and data you are authorized to access. Keep confidential or personal
material out of public issues and commits. Before adapting an example to a real system,
review inputs, effects, recovery and applicable provider terms. No paid model API,
credential, data transfer or production change is authorized by these notes.

Follow the [privacy notice](PRIVACY.md), [licensing inventory](docs/licensing.md) and
[security reporting guidance](SECURITY.md). Questions and requests for a separate
permission or service agreement go to [aekr@aekr.io](mailto:aekr@aekr.io).
Changes to these notes do not retroactively withdraw existing license permissions or
authorize a new use of previously collected information.
